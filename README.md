# Web-Design-Challenge

In the “WebVisualisations” folder I did the analysis for related homework (“Latitude”) and represented it on my created website.

Then in the “WebVisualisations-new dataset” folder I did another analysis 
on a new dataset which was from my last group project about “Relationship between house price and distance from CBD in Melbourne” and  I represented it on my created website as well.
